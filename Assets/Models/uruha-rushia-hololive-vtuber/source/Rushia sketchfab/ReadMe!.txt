Unity VRChat-Ready Package

***Please rate and review if you liked my work***


-The unity VRChat ready package is setup for use in VRChat.
It is setup with Full body tracking, eye-tracking, lip-sync, hair physics and facial expressions (gestures).
In order to use cloth or hair physics, you must have dynamic bone asset purchased from the asset store and imported into
your project before importing the vrchat package.

If you want to increase your avatar performance, you can try to delete some dynamic bone components (physics component) 
in the hair & clothing.

To edit cloth and hair physics movement values. Go to character heirachy > dynamic bones > find dynamic bone component 
(physics component) attached to it. Go to the component & edit its values. 
You can also remove the components if you don't want physics.

Facial expressions have been overriden in the avatar through gestures. You don't have to do anything. Just upload and Enjoy!


***To Use VRChat-ready package: Create a fresh unity project in unity 2019.4.31f1. Import the vrc sdk 3.0 and the dynamic bone
(If you want to use cloth and hair physics) asset into the project. Import VRChat ready package in that project. Open the 
scene file or drag the vrchat prefab into your scene. > Select character in the scene and upload.

Dynamic bone asset is 3rd party asset and can be purchased from the unity assetstore. It gives realistic physics on hair,
cloth, breasts etc.
